![Noam Miko](/albumPlaceholder.svg)

Hi, I’m Noam, a 21-year-old audio engineer, music producer, and founder of **Miko Recording Studio**, based in **Guelph, Ontario**. With over 6 years of experience in audio production, I’ve been helping artists record, mix, and master high-quality music since launching my studio in 2023 at just 18 years old.

As a musician myself, I create and release original music under the name **Noam Miko** and perform in a local band. This gives me a unique edge when working with other artists; I understand the creative process from both sides of the glass.

At Miko Recording Studio, I offer affordable, professional **recording**, **mixing**, **mastering**, and **music production services** for artists of all genres and languages. My mission is to deliver **industry-level sound** without the industry price tag.

Whether you’re recording your first track or putting the finishing touches on an album, I’m passionate about helping you capture your sound the way it was meant to be heard. Let’s make something incredible together.
